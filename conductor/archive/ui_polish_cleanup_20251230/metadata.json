(2) Add a visualization of the title and background in the \"Sample Title\" visual design on a rectangle with the same background as the selected background with the following settings: Brand Palette: Primary Color and Secondary Color. (3) The \"Insert Emoji\" button inside an existing target edit modal should open the emoji selection modal above the edit modal.
